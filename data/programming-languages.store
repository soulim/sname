      to run under control of IBM Basic Programming Support (BPS/360) on systems with
      only 8 KB of main memory, and only a card reader, a card punch, and a printer
      for input/output — thus the word "Basic". However, the full name and the initialism
      "BAL" almost immediately attached themselves in popular use to all assembly-language
      dialects on the System/360 and its descendants. BAL for BPS/360 was introduced
      with the System/360 in 1964.

      its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of
      knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers
      of KIF likened it to PostScript. PostScript was not designed primarily as a
      language to store and manipulate documents but rather as an interchange format
      for systems and devices to share documents. In the same way KIF is meant to
      facilitate sharing of knowledge across different systems that use different

      that compiles to JavaScript. It can be used to develop web applications, server
      side apps, and also desktop applications with use of Electron. Its syntax is
      mostly comparable to that of Haskell. In addition, it introduces row polymorphism
      and extensible records. Also, contrary to Haskell, PureScript adheres to a strict
      evaluation strategy.

      lab in the mid-1970s. The implementation was led by Ric Holt at the University
      of Toronto and James Cordy was the principal programmer for the first implementation
      of the compiler. It was originally designed for the Motorola 6809 microprocessor.
      It was considered innovative for the time; the compiler development team had
      a $2 million budget over 2 years and was commissioned by the Defense Advanced
      Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense and the Canadian
      Department of National Defence. It was used for a few years at I. P. Sharp Associates,
      MITRE Corporation, SRI International and various other international institutes

      undecidable. Most dependently typed proof assistants and later dependently typed
      languages such as Agda included a termination checker to prevent the type checker

      were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the

      use in computer assisted instruction (CAI) and computer managed instruction
      (CMI) and has many features for that purpose. For example, TUTOR has powerful
      answer-parsing and answer-judging commands, graphics, and features to simplify
      handling student records and statistics by instructors. TUTOR's flexibility,
      in combination with PLATO's computational power, also made it suitable for the
      creation of games — including flight simulators, war games, dungeon style multiplayer
      role-playing games, card games, word games, and medical lesson games such as
      Bugs and Drugs (BND). TUTOR lives on today as the programming language for the
      Cyber1 PLATO System, which runs most of the source code from 1980s PLATO and
      has roughly 5000 users as of June 2020.

      Store variable - place the contents of the accumulator in the variable.
      Jump label - transfer control to location labelled.
      Jineg label - transfer control to location labelled if the accumulator contains a negative value.
      Jizero label - transfer control to location labelled if the accumulator contains zero.
      Print literal - output the following string, delimited by single quotes.
      Line - output a carriage return
      In - allow user to input a numerical value from the console.
      Out - Output the contents of the accumulator as a decimal integer, signed if negative.
      Add value - add the variable or immediate integer value to the accumulator.
      Subtract value - subtract the variable or immediate integer from the accumulator.
      Multiply value - place the product of the accumulator and the variable or immediate integer in the accumulator.

      Obliq is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language designed to make distributed, and locally multithreaded, computing simpler and easier to program, while providing program safety and an implicit type system. The interpreter is written in Modula-3, and provides Obliq with full access to Modula-3's network objects abilities. A type inference algorithm for record concatenation, subtyping, and recursive types has been developed for Obliq. Further, it has been proved to be NP-complete
      and its lowest complexity to be Ο(n3) or if under other modeling up to certain conditions down to Ο(n2) and its best known implementation runs in Ο(n5).
      Obliq's syntax is very similar to Modula-3, the biggest difference being that Obliq has no need of explicit typed variables although explicit type declarations are allowed and ignored by the interpreter. The basic data types in the language include booleans, integers, reals, characters, strings, and arrays. Obliq supports the usual set of sequential control structures, and special control forms for concurrency. Further, Obliq's objects can be cloned and safely copied remotely by any machine in a distributed network object and it can be done safely and transparently.

      created by Brian and Andy Frank that runs on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
      JavaScript, and the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). Its primary design goal
      is to provide a standard library API that abstracts away the question of whether
      the code will ultimately run on the JRE or CLR. Like C# and Java, Fantom uses
      a curly brace syntax. The language supports functional programming through closures
      and concurrency through the Actor model. Fantom takes a "middle of the road"
      approach to its type system, blending together aspects of both static and dynamic
      typing.

      Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly
      targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript or native code, e.g. for native
      iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps. Language development costs
      are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.

      type annotations, and ensures type safety – there is a formal proof that a well-typed
      ML program does not cause runtime type errors. ML provides pattern matching
      for function arguments, garbage collection, imperative programming, call-by-value
      and currying. It is used heavily in programming language research and is one
      of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics.
      Its types and pattern matching make it well-suited and commonly used to operate
      on other formal languages, such as in compiler writing, automated theorem proving,
      and formal verification.

The editor has been used in creating several popular custom maps, including Defense of the Ancients. The level editor was substantially improved for The Frozen Throne and allowed users to create cut scenes supporting voice-overs.
      Advanced features of the editor allow for custom models, tilesets and icons. The editor also supports Blizzard's JASS scripting language for programming complex actions otherwise not supported by the graphical interface.

      calculations, for transporting and storing data and for interpreting the user's
      commands, and the library, a set of programs which can perform more complicated
      calculations. The target audience for the language is the biosciences, so the
      library consisted of routines such as those to compute pairwise alignments,
      phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments, and to make secondary structure
      predictions.

      and released to users from both industry and academia; up to 1,000 registered
      users were recorded in due course. The language, however, was only intended
      to provide a proof of concept for an experiment in persistent programming; some

      is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a
      general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers
      write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on
      all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications
      are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine
      (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java
      is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
      The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities that are typically not available
      in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular
      programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server

    :name: Interactive fiction
    :description: |2-

      Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of interactive narratives or interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be "text-only", however, graphical text adventures still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as "Puzzle-free", that focuses on narrative, and "text adventures" that focus on puzzles.

      of Modula-2, the direct successor of Pascal, and simultaneously to reduce its
      complexity. Its principal new feature is the concept of type extension of record
      types: It permits the construction of new data types on the basis of existing
      ones and to relate them, deviating from the dogma of strictly static data typing.
      Type extension is Wirth''s way of inheritance reflecting the viewpoint of the
      parent site. Oberon was developed as part of the implementation of the Oberon
      operating system at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. The name is from the moon of

    :description: Escher is a declarative programming language that supports both
      functional programming and logic programming models, developed by J.W. Lloyd
      in the mid-1990s. It was designed mostly as a research and teaching vehicle.
      The basic view of programming exhibited by Escher and related languages is that
      a program is a representation of a theory in some logic framework, and the program's
      execution (computation) is a deduction from the theory. The logic framework
      for Escher is Alonzo Church's simple theory of types.

      language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community, first released

      language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early
      1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and
      Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to
      interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple
      products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler
      framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014.
      On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C,
      Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.

      Lisp is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
      Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Racket, Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.

Pig Latin abstracts the programming from the Java MapReduce idiom into a notation which makes MapReduce programming high level, similar to that of SQL for relational database management systems. Pig Latin can be extended using user-defined functions (UDFs) which the user can write in Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby or Groovy and then call directly from the language.

    :description: A microassembler is a computer program that helps prepare a microprogram,
      called firmware, to control the low level operation of a computer in much the
      same way an assembler helps prepare higher level code for a processor. The difference
      is that the microprogram is usually only developed by the processor manufacturer
      and works intimately with the computer hardware. On a microprogrammed computer
      the microprogram implements the operations of the instruction set in which any
      normal program is written. The use of a microprogram allows the manufacturer
      to fix certain mistakes, including working around hardware design errors, without
      modifying the hardware. Another means of employing microassembler-generated
      microprograms is in allowing the same hardware to run different instruction
      sets. After it is assembled, the microprogram is then loaded to a control store
      to become part of the logic of a CPU's control unit.
