# Contribution guidelines

Pull requests are always welcome :heart:


Here are a few things it might make sense to consider before opening
a pull request:

- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes
  you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider
  submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Note: If editing the README, please conform to the [standard-readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)
specification.
